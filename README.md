## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Over the years, car sales have increased drastically around the world and today, cars are more commonplace in society than ever before. The global climate emergency has increased the impetus on reducing green house gas emissions in to the atmosphere. Hence, until the transition to e-mobility it is crucial to lessen the effects of climate change caused by the transportation sector. Further, with most cars still using fossil fuels it has become increasingly important to have high engine efficiencies and reduced carbon emssions. A car with a good fuel economy is a boon to the owner and the environment as it helps reduce operational costs and mitigates the effect of global warming. However, with so many different models, segments and makes of cars; it is difficult to quantify one parameter to compare cars across all varieties. Hence, through this project I wish to identify the car model that has the best fuel economy and the lowest carbon dioxide emissions. Further, I would like to see what are the most influencing features that affect the CO2 emission the most?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset I am using for the project has been found from [Open Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64). The dataset contains various specifications of the vehicles and the resuts obtained from 5 cycle testing collected by Environment and Climate Change Canada. Manufacturers use the 5-cycle testing procedure which is an improved procedure that tests for city and highway conditions as well as operating a vehicle in cold weather, the use of air conditioners, and driving at higher speeds with more rapid acceleration and braking. The dataset is created and updated every year by Natural Resources Canada in order to make the automotive manufacturers accountable and also have some degree of transparency. The Fuel Consumption Ratings have been presented for the year 2020. I am speculating that in the dataset; the fuel consumption will be directly related to the carbon dioxide emissions.
